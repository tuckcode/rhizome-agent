# Spreadsheets

Rhizome sheets are spreadsheet notes. They keep the same file-first model as other notes, but a note with `_display: sheet` opens in a spreadsheet editor instead of the rich text editor. The note's `type` remains available for organization.

The durable file is still Markdown with YAML frontmatter. The body is CSV-like text containing cell inputs and formulas, and spreadsheet presentation state is stored as plain YAML under `_sheet`.

## Why Sheet Notes

Sheets are useful when information is better modeled as rows, columns, and formulas than as prose. Examples include budgets, revenue models, inventories, editorial calendars, lightweight trackers, and analytical scratchpads.

Rhizome does not store sheets as opaque workbook binaries. A sheet should remain:

- readable in a text editor
- diffable in Git
- editable by humans and AI agents
- available offline
- connected to the rest of the vault through types, properties, relationships, and wikilinks

## One Note, One Sheet

A sheet note is a single sheet. Rhizome does not expose multiple tabs inside one note.

When a model needs more than one table, create more than one sheet note and connect them with wikilinks or cross-sheet formulas. This keeps each file small, legible, and aligned with Rhizome's graph model.

For example:

- `newsletter-revenue.md`
- `sponsorship-pipeline.md`
- `refactoring-business-plan.md`

Each can be a normal `_display: sheet` note, and formulas can reference cells in another sheet note with Rhizome's wikilink cell syntax.

## Editing

The interactive sheet editor is backed by IronCalc. Rhizome uses IronCalc for spreadsheet behavior and formula evaluation, then adapts the workbook back to Rhizome's plain-text note format.

In the sheet editor:

- cell inputs that start with `=` are formulas
- non-formula cells can contain normal text, numbers, dates, and `[[wikilinks]]`
- typing `[[` in a cell opens the same note autocomplete concept used elsewhere in Rhizome
- typing a formula function name opens inline formula autocomplete for the bundled IronCalc function catalog
- right-clicking a selection exposes core formatting controls such as number formats, decimal precision, bold, italic, and clear formatting

Keyboard basics follow spreadsheet conventions:

- arrow keys move the active cell
- `Shift` with arrows extends the selection
- `Enter` starts editing the active cell
- `Escape` exits cell editing while keeping focus in the sheet
- `Delete` or `Backspace` clears the selected range
- copy and paste should preserve formulas, including Rhizome cross-sheet references

## Wikilinks In Cells

Wikilinks in non-formula cells are stored as normal Rhizome wikilinks:

```csv
Project,Owner,Status
[[website-redesign]],[[person/alice]],Active
[[sponsorship-pipeline]],[[person/matteo]],Review
```

The cell still behaves like a spreadsheet cell, but the value remains a vault link that Rhizome can understand.

## Cross-Sheet Formulas

Rhizome adds a sheet-note reference syntax on top of IronCalc formulas:

```txt
=[[newsletter-revenue]].B5
=SUM(B2:D2)+[[sponsorship-pipeline]].E12
=[[refactoring-business-plan]].$C$18
```

The target before the dot is a normal Rhizome wikilink target. The part after the dot is an A1-style cell address.

Relative and absolute references work like spreadsheet references when copied:

- `[[revenue]].B5` can shift when pasted to another cell
- `[[revenue]].$B$5` stays fixed
- `[[revenue]].B$5` fixes the row
- `[[revenue]].$B5` fixes the column

This is not the same as an IronCalc workbook tab reference. It is Rhizome-specific syntax for referencing another sheet note in the vault.

Current cross-sheet formulas resolve single cells. Ranges across sheet notes are not a stable file-format feature yet, so prefer composing them from explicit cell references or keeping range formulas inside the same sheet note.

## Storage

A minimal sheet note looks like this:

```md
---
type: Project
_display: sheet
status: Draft
belongs_to:
  - "[[business-plan]]"
_sheet:
  frozen_rows: 1
  columns:
    A:
      width: 180
  cells:
    E6:
      num_fmt: "0.00%"
---
Metric,January,February,March,Q1 Total
Subscriptions,1200,1350,1500,=SUM(B2:D2)
Services,800,900,750,=SUM(B3:D3)
Expenses,650,700,760,=SUM(B4:D4)
Net,=B2+B3-B4,=C2+C3-C4,=D2+D3-D4,=SUM(B5:D5)
Growth,,=(C5-B5)/B5,=(D5-C5)/C5,=(E5-B5)/B5
```

Normal frontmatter stays normal Rhizome metadata. `_sheet` is system metadata for the spreadsheet editor and is hidden from normal property editing.

## Formulas

Rhizome delegates formula calculation to IronCalc. IronCalc aims for Excel-compatible formulas, while its project documentation still describes it as work in progress. For Rhizome-specific formula behavior and the autocomplete function catalog, see [Spreadsheet Formulas](/reference/spreadsheet-functions).
