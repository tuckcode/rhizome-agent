# Use Spreadsheets

Rhizome spreadsheets are sheet notes: Markdown files with frontmatter and a CSV-like body that open in a spreadsheet editor when their `Display as` value is `Sheet`.

Use a sheet note when a model needs rows, columns, calculations, or repeated numeric editing. Use a normal note when the main artifact is prose.

## Create A Sheet

Use the command palette action `New Sheet`, or create/open a note and set its `Display as` to `Sheet` from the Properties panel. `Type` remains separate and can still be `Note`, `Project`, `Responsibility`, or any other Rhizome type.

When a note is a sheet:

- the YAML frontmatter remains available for type, status, relationships, wikilinks, and custom properties
- `_display: sheet` tells Rhizome to display the note with the spreadsheet editor
- the body is the sheet itself
- there is no rich-text body around the table
- the editor switches from the text editor to the spreadsheet editor

## Enter Values

Click a cell and type a value. Non-formula values can be text, numbers, dates, or wikilinks.

Press `Enter` on a selected cell to edit the cell. Press `Escape` while editing to leave cell editing and keep focus in the sheet.

Use `Delete` or `Backspace` to clear the selected cell or range.

## Enter Formulas

Formulas start with `=`.

```txt
=B2+B3-B4
=SUM(B2:D2)
=ROUND(E6, 2)
=IF(E6>0, "Up", "Down")
```

Rhizome shows inline formula autocomplete while you type. The autocomplete list is built from the implemented function catalog in the bundled IronCalc engine; formula evaluation is still handled by IronCalc.

See [Spreadsheet Formulas](/reference/spreadsheet-functions) for syntax, supported examples, and links to the full IronCalc formula reference.

## Select And Edit Ranges

The sheet editor follows spreadsheet conventions:

- arrow keys move the active cell
- `Shift` plus arrow keys extends the selection
- drag to select a range
- copy and paste preserves formulas where possible
- cut and paste moves formulas and shifts relative references
- right-click a selected cell or range to apply formatting

Right-click actions apply to the current selection. Keep a multi-cell selection active before opening the context menu when you want to format several cells together.

## Format Cells

Use the context menu for common formatting:

- number formats such as plain numbers, currency, and percentages
- decimal precision
- bold and italic text
- alignment and clearing formatting when available

Formatting is stored as plain YAML under `_sheet`, not in an opaque workbook blob. For example, percentage formatting for `E6` is stored as:

```yaml
_sheet:
  cells:
    E6:
      num_fmt: "0.00%"
```

See [Spreadsheet File Format](/reference/spreadsheet-format) for the full storage model.

## Add Wikilinks

Type `[[` in a cell to open note autocomplete.

```csv
Project,Owner,Status
[[website-redesign]],[[person/alice]],Active
[[sponsorship-pipeline]],[[person/matteo]],Review
```

When the cell is not being edited, Rhizome renders the wikilink like other note links. When you edit the cell, the raw `[[wikilink]]` syntax is shown again.

Command-click a wikilink in a sheet cell to open the linked note.

## Reference Another Sheet Note

Formulas can read a cell from another sheet note with Rhizome's wikilink cell syntax:

```txt
=[[newsletter-revenue]].B5
=SUM(B2:D2)+[[sponsorship-pipeline]].E12
=ROUND([[business-plan]].$E$12, 2)
```

The part inside `[[...]]` resolves like a normal Rhizome wikilink. The part after the dot is an A1-style cell reference.

Use absolute markers when copying formulas:

| Reference | Copy behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `[[revenue]].B5` | row and column can shift |
| `[[revenue]].$B$5` | row and column stay fixed |
| `[[revenue]].B$5` | row fixed, column can shift |
| `[[revenue]].$B5` | column fixed, row can shift |

Cross-sheet references currently resolve single cells. Keep range formulas inside one sheet note.

## Work With The Raw File

A sheet file remains readable text:

```md
---
type: Project
_display: sheet
status: Draft
belongs_to:
  - "[[business-plan]]"
_sheet:
  frozen_rows: 1
  columns:
    A:
      width: 180
---
Metric,January,February,March,Q1 Total
Subscriptions,1200,1350,1500,=SUM(B2:D2)
Services,800,900,750,=SUM(B3:D3)
Expenses,650,700,760,=SUM(B4:D4)
Net,=B2+B3-B4,=C2+C3-C4,=D2+D3-D4,=SUM(B5:D5)
```

When editing this file with scripts or AI agents, parse the body as CSV and preserve formulas as formulas. Do not replace formulas with displayed values.
